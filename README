NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Repository - Automatically sets repository URL from
    svn/svk/Git checkout for Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.15

SYNOPSIS
        # dist.ini
        [Repository]

DESCRIPTION
    The code is mostly a copy-paste of Module::Install::Repository

  ATTRIBUTES
    *   git_remote

        This is the name of the remote to use for the public repository (if
        you use Git). By default, unsurprisingly, to origin.

    *   github_http

        If the remote is a GitHub repository, uses the http url
        (http://github.com/fayland/dist-zilla-plugin-repository) rather than
        the actual clonable url
        (git://github.com/fayland/dist-zilla-plugin-repository.git).
        Defaults to true.

        You may want to set this to false if you're including a META.json
        file, as Meta 2 has separate keys for machine-readable "url" and
        human-readable "web". This affects only the "url" key.

    *   repository

        You can set this attribute if you want a specific repository instead
        of the plugin to auto-identify your repository.

        An example would be if you're releasing a module from your fork, and
        you don't want it to identify your fork, so you can specify the
        repository explicitly.

        In the Meta 2 spec, this is the "url" key.

    *   type

        This should be the (lower-case) name of the most common program used
        to work with the repository, e.g. git, svn, cvs, darcs, bzr or hg.
        It's normally determined automatically, but you can override it.

    *   web

        This is a URL pointing to a human-usable web front-end for the
        repository. Currently, only Github repositories get this set
        automatically.
